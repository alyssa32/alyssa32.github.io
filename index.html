<div class="indent">I am a current Film Studies Major student at Concordia, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the Specialization in the 
Computation Arts program. As much as I enjoy the study of moving pictures, I am more passionate about creating digital media. Thus, 
I am determined and motivated to pursue a career as a 3D artist. </div>
</br>
</br>
<div class="indent">
I have over 10 years of technical drawing experience from taking art classes at Atelier de Brésoles, La Palette Art School, and
 animating art programs at an elementary level which is my current job. However, my interest in digital art grew as of the beginning 
 of the pandemic, where I began to learn 3D modeling and experiment with animation using Blender. Once having grasped an understanding 
 of the software, I developed a great passion for creating 3D models. With my digital artwork improving, Nu Age Films, a music video 
 production company, offered me an internship where I assisted to model digital assets called NFTs for the American rapper Ice-T. This 
 project further taught me about Blender’s tools but also about collaboration. As a young artist, my artworks have been created solely 
 by myself, so I was pleased to experience the interchanging of ideas/constructive criticism, and help brought on by this project. I 
 was then assigned another project where I was to edit the behind the scenes footage for Senior’s Sun Girl music video. Having taken a 
 film production course in college, I already had basic knowledge using Adobe Premiere Pro to edit short films. Throughout this opportunity,
  my 3D modeling and editing capability grew, and I experienced working on a project with another artist.</div>
</br>
</br>
<div class="indent">Another project I was and still am devoted to, is a humanitarian trip to Armenia this summer with my scouting group at AGBU Montreal 
Scouts. With a goal of raising $58,000 for our team to build an art studio for young Armenian kids affected by the border crisis between
 Armenia and Azerbaijan. In order to pay for our trip and the materials we will be providing, I hosted one of our fundraising events which
  taught me about the hardships of leadership. </div>
</br>
</br>
<div class="indent">My career goal led me to find the Specialization in the Computation Arts program at Concordia. After my first year in Film Studies, it had
 been too late for me to apply for an internal transfer so I spent this year continuing to learn Blender while improving my portfolio to 
 fit this program’s requirements. However, I did not believe my technical drawings and 3D models were enough to make my portfolio stand out,
  as I had no programming knowledge. Therefore, I signed up for an online coding course on SheCodes, which taught me enough HTML, CSS, and 
  JavaScript for me to code my own interactive website. I am a motivated artist, determined to get into the Computation Arts program as it
   will equip me for my desired career path. I am mostly interested in 3D modeling but I am open to expanding my knowledge on multimedia, 
   digital arts, visual effects, and graphic design, whilst also developing proficiency in programming.
</br>
</br>
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

            <h3>Alyssa #3</h3>
            <p>An advertisment of my personal brand I 3D modeled using blender. I used the surrounding environment 
              to tell as much about the product without using words whilst designing the overall image to be visually 
              appealing. The fruity scent of the perfume is told by the peaches on the right, and it's freshness by
               the cut fruit and beach in the background.  </p>

            <h3>Ice T</h3>
            <p>Using Blender, I collaborated with Nu Age Films, a music video production company, to model an Ice-T glass filled with iced tea, during my
               internship. My main contributions were sculpting the rapper’s face onto the glass, texturing the facial 
               hair and the orange slice. This 3D model was requested to be made by the rapper Ice-T, to later be held 
               as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token). </p>

            <h3>Early Trip to Work</h3>
            <p>I modeled a low poly world in Blender, an environment design possible for a game. By adding in a car, I added
              life and set the mood with the warm sunlight hinting at dawn or a sunset. </p>

            <h3>As A Screen</h3>
            <p>Guided by a CrossMind Studio YouTube turorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgJaMGx6XM), I modeled a scene full 
              of objects found on my desk beside me in Blender. I imagined the viewer to be observing the scene as my computer screen if I had 
              flipped my desk, causing objects to fly upwards. The mouse and cursor represent my passion for creating digital art. The pencil 
              speaks for my interest in pencil drawing, headphones for my love of music. Water being my favourite beverage, and avocado my favourite fruit. </p>

              <h3>Self Portrait</h3>
              <p>A pencil drawing I did of myself, not only to practice capturing facial features but to also record myself in that given time. By having drawn 
                my self-portrait, I have a time stamp of my appearance and artistic capability of when I completed this artwork. </p>

              <p>A still life drawing of a skull using charcoal on grey paper. Having covered the paper in black first, I erased where the skull was reflecting light.
                This technique pushed me to approach this light study backwards, comparing to what I am used to with a pencil and paper

              <p>This pastel and colouring pencil drawing is my earliest artwork. Having been disgusted by this cruel sport, I aimed to capture the 
                aggressive behaviour shown towards animals, such as horses and bulls.

              <p>This still-life drawing was made with white pastel and pencil on grey paper. Focusing this light study drawing not only on the direct light 
                hitting the egg, but also the light reflecting off the table. Allowing the viewer to appreciate the subtle details of such a subtle object. </p>

              <p>Using Procreate, I designed this logo for Agoump Cafe. This cafe was run by our scouts team in order to raise money
             for our humanitarian trip to Armenia this summer of 2023. I kept the design of the mug simple to allow the coffee colours to stand out, 
           which were inspired by the Armenian flag. The "o" is replaced by Armenia's eternity sign which symbolizes the identity of it's nation. </p>
