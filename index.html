            <p>
<div class="indent">  My artistic practice explores the complex relationship between nature, technology, and human influence. 
  Through a combination of 3D modeling, drawing, and mixed media, I examine how perception shapes our understanding of the environment 
  and challenge the ways we interact with the natural world. I am particularly interested in the subtle imprints we leave 
  behind—whether physical, digital, or sensory. My work often reflects on how nature is framed, controlled, or altered, inviting 
  viewers to reconsider what is seen, heard, and felt. I aim to visualize the hidden forces at play—whether through the distortion of 
  landscapes, the lasting presence of sound, or the tension between control and resistance. Rather than presenting nature as something 
  distant or idealized, I use art to highlight its dynamic, evolving state, shaped by both human and non-human forces. My work serves
   as a bridge between reality and perception, encouraging a deeper awareness of the environment and our place within it.

            <h3>Framed Reality</h3>
            <p>   My artwork explores the contrast between technology and nature in shaping our perception of reality. I have
               created two televisions, each representing a different way of experiencing the world. The first is a retro 
               television, made of processed wood, plastic, and metal. It sits alone in a stark, empty room—an isolated object, 
               much like how media can sometimes disconnect us from reality. Its glossy screen reflects faint images of a forest, 
               offering only a fragmented, controlled version of nature, limiting what the viewer sees. In contrast, the second 
               television is crafted entirely from raw materials—wood, stone, and bark. Its antenna is a natural wooden branch, 
               its knobs are rocks, and its most striking feature is the absence of a screen. Without a barrier between the 
               viewer and their surroundings, this piece invites them to engage directly with the world—to see, feel, and 
               experience reality without the filter of media. By removing the screen, it opens up the senses, allowing for a 
               personal, unfiltered perception of nature rather than a mediated one.

            <h3>Seeing Sound</h3>
            <p>       This 3D artwork explores the idea that sound never truly disappears—it only fades beyond human perception.
              According to the law of conservation of energy, sound waves do not vanish, they simply lose energy over time, 
              continuing to exist in its environment. The scene presents a seemingly natural landscape, however the space appears 
              warped and shifted near the base of the trees, visualizing a build-up of lingering sound waves throughout history. 
              This distortion is not meant to be seen as sound pollution in a negative sense, but rather as a reminder of the 
              unseen energies from our world’s past. </p>

            <h3>Weighted Silence</h3>
            <p>       Saying “no” when people ask something of me, is one of the main things I struggle with. I end up taking on
               so many tasks, that I sacrifice my healthy eating habits, sleep, and a calm state of mind. The concept behind my 
               work is not just a visual representation of how I feel when I undergo stress, the creature is my stress. The environment 
               is familiar to me, as it is where I spend most of my time working catching up on projects until night. The mounds of work 
               I have pilled up is why she has additional fingers and hands growing out of her arms. I imagine my creature would make 
               minimal noise walking around and in general, just like how I work in silence. If you were to reach inside my mind and 
               somehow visualize my stress, I would think this creature would be found inside.

            <h3>Rooted in Silence</h3>
            <p>         Exploring the connection between environmental destruction and the oppression of women, the sepia coloured 
              ink drawing shows a dead tree with seven female figures trapped within its trunk, their bodies tangled in the wood. 
              Some branches take the shape of hands, reaching outward. The tree stands alone in an empty space, symbolizing loss and 
              isolation. This piece is inspired by ecofeminism, which sees a link between the way nature and women are often controlled, 
              used, and overlooked. Just as forests are cut down for resources, women—especially those in marginalized communities—often 
              suffer the most from environmental harm while having little say in the decisions that cause it. The figures in the tree 
              represent both pain and strength, showing how women and nature continue to exist despite exploitation.

              <h3>The Last Fight</h3>
              <p>"The Last Fight" critiques the cruelty of rodeo practices and the struggle for freedom. The horse is drawn using pastels, 
                full of life and movement, while the cowboys are in black and white pencil, making them feel cold and detached. This contrast 
                highlights the imbalance between the horse and its faceless captors. This piece invites viewers to consider the ethics of rodeo 
                culture and the power struggle between human control and an animal’s right to freedom. </p>

             for our humanitarian trip to Armenia this summer of 2023. I kept the design of the mug simple to allow the coffee colours to stand out,
